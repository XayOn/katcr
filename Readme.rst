\:white_check_mark\: Experimental torrent streaming
---------------------------------------------------

**This is an experimental feature!!**

Using another library of mine, `torrentstream <http://github.com/XayOn/torrentstream>`_
I added experimental streaming support. That requires `libtorrent <http://www.libtorrent.org/>`_.

Deluge guys have a good `tutorial <http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Building/libtorrent>`_
on how to get libtorrent going on multiple systems`

Support on windows / MacOs is probably not working on this feature.
Please, if you've tested it on windows / MacOs contact me so we can
work on that support.


\:star\: Installation
---------------------

This is a python3.5 package available on pypi.

On windows and mac `you can download python3.5 here <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/>`_.
On linux distros, python3.5 is already on most package managers :smile:

With python3.5 installed just execute::

    pip3.5 install katcr


If it asks about permissions and you don't know what to do, you should
probably read `Jamie Matthews's article about virtualenvs <https://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/>`_

\:star2\: Notes
----------------

This project is made with the best of intentions. For that times
you need to search for somethink shared as a torrent on KAT
(I.E, linux images). Logo is based on robot cat by
`Arsenty <https://thenounproject.com/arsenty/>`_

If you like this project, show its appreciation by starring it, if you're using
it and want to write to me personally, feel free to do so at
opensource@davidfrancos.net. If you've got a bug to report, please use the
