Installation
------------

This is a python package available on pypi, just run

.. code:: bash

    pip install katcr

Make sure your python version is at least python3.8 and you're using that
version's pip.

Streaming
---------

Streaming requires `libtorrent <https://www.libtorrent.org/>`_ . 
With libtorrent installed, you'll need to install katcr's streaming extras, for
that matter, install it with [stream], 

.. code:: bash

    pip install katcr[stream]

Then, just run it with 

.. code:: bash

        poetry run katcr search --engines Skytorrents,ThePirateBay "Big Buck Bunny" --interactive  --stream

Features
--------

- Display results in a nice utf-8 table
- Optional interactive mode, choose and open torrent with a nice text user interface
- Open torrent directly with your preferred client (via xdg-open)
- Stream torrent with `torrentstream <https://github.com/XayOn/torrentstream>`_
- Searches on all available engines until it gets results by default.
- Search torrents in:

  + Eztv
  + `Jackett <https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett>`_
  + Katcr
  + NyaaSi
  + Skytorrents
  + ThePirateBay


Jackett Support
---------------

You can easily use a `Jackett <https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett>`_ instance
to search on all your configured provider.

This allows you to search on any jackett-supported site (that's about supported
300 trackers).

Jackett is probably the best way to use katcr and katbot, as it has a more
active mantainance of the tracker sites that us.

To enable Jackett use, simply export your jackett URL and TOKEN as variables::

   JACKETT_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:9117 JACKETT_APIKEY=<redacted> poetry run katcr --engines=


Notes
------

This project is made with the best of intentions.

For that times you need to search for somethink shared as a torrent on KAT
(I.E, linux images). Logo is based on robot cat by
`Arsenty <https://thenounproject.com/arsenty/>`_
